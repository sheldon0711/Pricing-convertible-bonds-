    "# Introduction\n",
    "A convertible bond is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of shares of common stock in the issuing company or cash of equal value. It could be viewed as the combination of bonds and call options on the underlying securities. This interpretation allows us to price convertible bonds using standard option pricing techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "The market of convertible bonds is booming in China. For the first half of 2019, there are 62 convertible bonds, worth of 20 billion USD, that went into public. The number of bonds increased by 210% and the amount of money increased by 570% over the same period last year. The latter even exceeded last year's total amount. Accordingly, there are tons of capital pouring into this market. Some have claimed that the new era of the market of convertible bonds has come in China.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons behind this boom. Firstly, since Chinese government put more restrictions on financing methods during 2018, listed company have to resort to other ways, such as convertible bonds, to fund themselves. In addition, the embedded option to convert bonds to stocks makes convertible bonds more stock-like and easier to speculate. Compared to those of the Chinese A-share stock market, the characters of the convertible bonds market, such as T+0 trading system and no limit on the rise of fall in a single trading day, are more favorable for many institutional investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical convertible bond listed in China contains four provisions that could significantly influence the price of it: the convert provisions, the redemption provision, the put provision and the reset provision. All of the provisions, except for the convert provision, is highly path-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convert provision allows the bondholder to convert the bond into a specified number of shares, which equals to the face value of the bonds divided by the conversion price, of underlying common stock. This is a very classic American call option on the stock. In theory, the holder of American call option won’t exercise in advance. Generally, the start date of conversion is 6 months after the first listing date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The redemption provision is the right of issuer to call back the bond at a pre-determined price. For example: “During the duration of convertible period, if the close price of the company's stock is not less than 130% of the current convertible price (including 130%) for at least 15 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading days, the company has the right to redeem part or all of the convertible bonds according to the face value of the bonds plus the current accrued interest”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The put provision entitles the holder to sell back the bonds to the issuer if the stock price is significantly lower than the conversion price. In general, this right could only be exercised during the last one or two years of the duration of the bond. For instance, “Since the fifth interest-bearing year of convertible bonds, if the closing price of the company's stock is lower than 70% of the current convertible price for 30 consecutive trading days, the holder of convertible bonds has the right to sell all or part of the convertible bonds he holds back to the company at face value of 103% (including the interest of the current interest-bearing year”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reset provision is the right of issuer to lower the conversion price under certain conditions. A typical reset provision is as the following: “During the duration of convertible bonds, when the closing price of the company's stock on is below 90% of the current convertible price for at least 10 trading days of any 20 consecutive trading days, the board of directors of the issuing company has the right to propose a downward revision of the convertible price and submit it to the shareholders' meeting to vote”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the other three provisions, which have definite path, the timing to reset is hard to determine in the real world. With the reset clause, the price of convertible bonds will suffer considerable fluctuations, especially when the underlying stock price is severely depressed. In particular, the issuer would be exposed to the risk of conversion failure if the underlying stock price is substantially lower than the conversion price. That is to say, bond investors will demand redemption before maturity, causing heavy cash flow burden to the issuer and endanger the financial situation of the issuer. One the other hand, exercising reset clause would not only dilute existing shareholders but also indicate that the management has little faith in the future stock price. In addition, the extend of conversion price reduction is not pre-determined if the reset provision is exercised. Therefore, whether to execute this right is a complex trade-off faced by the issuer. In the real world, there are several convertible bonds in the market that meet the conditions to reset but refused to do so for a very long period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the execution of reset provision depends largely on the subjectivity of the management, it’s difficult to include it into pricing model. Hence most literature generally assumes that the conversion price is fixed and ignores the reset provision. Here, to minimize the effect of reset provision, we only study the convertible bonds price for the first 6 months after listing, when the stock price normally would not deviate too much from the conversion price and trigger the reset clause."

    "Owing to the characters of redemption provision, put provision and the reset provision, the convertible bond listed in China is a highly path-dependent instrument, which could be valued through Monte Carlo simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Simulation is widely used multiple fields. It is applicable to the pricing of multi-dimensional derivatives with characteristics such as discrete coupon dividends and path dependence. Therefore, it has gradually become one of the most effective pricing methods for convertible bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of Monte Carlo simulation is to generate multiple paths of underlying stock price and to find out the optimal exit of the convertible bond, i.e., whether the bond would be hold to maturity or convert option/ call option/ put option/ reset option would be exercised prior to the maturity. With lots of repeated stochastic simulations on the path of stock prices, the average of the payoffs is the final value of the convertible bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we try to make our analysis as close to the real-world condition as possible. In other words, we run our simulation based on the specific provisions of different convertible bonds. "

    "1)\tOn each date of pricing, set the close price of underlying stock on that date as S(0), ∆t as 1 day, and the length of steps as the remaining duration of days of the convertible bond to the maturity. Then we simulate the stock price according to the following equation:\n",

    "𝜇̂ - yield in a risk-neutral world. Here we used the yield of the treasury plus certain risk premium. The risk premium depends on the credit rating of the bond. (‘A+’—0.03, ‘AA-’— 0.027, ‘AA’— 0.025, ‘AA’ — 0.02, ‘AAA-’ — 0.017, ‘AAA’ — 0.015). For example, on the pricing date, if the convertible bond has a remaining 5.5-year duration, and the credit rating of it is ‘AAA’, then 𝜇̂ = the yield of 5.5-year treasury on the pricing date + 0.015. \n",
    "\n",
    "σ - volatility of the underlying stock price, or the standard deviation of return of stock. To reduce the periodical volatility spike, we used 65-day exponential moving average volatility instead.\n",

   "source": [
    "2)\tFor each simulation, when the steps of the path exceed the start date of redemption provision, we would examine whether the simulated stock prices meet the condition to exercise the redemption option. For instance, a common redemption provision would be like ‘15/30, 130%, 104’, meaning that during the past 30 trading days, if the underlying stock price has been higher than 130% of conversion price for at least 15 trading days, the issuer would buy back all the convertible bonds at the pre-determined redemption price of 104. The redemption price is between 103 to 108 for all convertible bonds trading on the market at present. On each step, we would check the stock prices for the previous 30 days, If the redemption condition is satisfied, all the bondholders would convert the bonds to stocks to achieve greater payoff. Since bondholders would gradually convert their bonds during this period when they expect the redemption provision would be triggered, we used the mean of the 30-day stock prices to calculate payoff. The execution of redemption would mean the end of the current path. Then we discount the payoff to the present pricing date as the expected payoff of this path:\n",

    "3)\tWhen the steps of the path exceed start date of put provision, if the redemption is not exercised, we would further check whether the simulated stock prices satisfy the condition to trigger the put provision. An example of put provision is ‘25/30, 70%, 102’, meaning that during the last 30 trading days, if the underlying stock price has been lower than 70% of the conversion price for at least 25 trading days, the bondholder would have the right to sell back the bond to the issuer at the pre-determined price of 102. At this scenario, all the bondholders would sell back the convertible bonds since the current stock price is significantly lower than the conversion price. The current path would be terminated when the put option is exercised. Then we would discount this payoff to the present date as the expected payoff. Hence, the payoff at this path would be:\n",

At the last day, bondholders would compare the payoff of convert the bond to stock with the redemption price.

So for each one of such a path, the payoff would be:\n",
